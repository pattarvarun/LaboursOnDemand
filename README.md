## Problem Statement<br>

The problem of unemployment among labourers is looming large.<br>They are unable to contact people with the right jobs for their skill set.<br> Hence, they resort to searching for a job through contractors.<br>Most contractors exploit the situation by paying the labourers a lesser fee than they deserve.<br>They make huge profits though they don’t toil nearly as hard as the labourers.

## Solution<br>

Our app aims at providing a solution to this problem. We aim to establish a direct contact between the labourers and the “customers” (customers who need service). The app focuses on cutting down the middle man, i.e. contractor, making unethical profits from the current existing situation of the labourers.  Through our app, the labourers directly receive their payment from the customer . Hence they get a fruitful result for their hard work on the field. This also reduces unemployment of skilled labourers which is a need of the hour.
